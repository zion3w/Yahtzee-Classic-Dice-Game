					<h1>&#x1F3B2; Yahtzee Rules</h1>
				</header>

				<p>
					Yahtzee is a classic dice game that uses five 6-sided dice. It’s easy to learn, quick to play, and
					accommodates any number of players. There’s a reason it’s been so popular for decades!
				</p>
				<p>
					Object of the Game The object of Yahtzee is for each player to roll dice and fill out their score
					card over the course of a series of rounds, trying to obtain the best rolls they can in 13 different
					combinations. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
				</p>

				<h2>How to Play Yahtzee</h2>
				<div>
					<a href="./img/rules.jpg" target="_blank">
						<img src="./img/rules.jpg" alt="Yahtzee rules" />
					</a>
				</div>

				<p>
					Choose a starting player by any method (oldest player, youngest player, highest roll of the dice,
					etc.)
				</p>
				<p>
					Beginning with the starting player, players will take turns one at a time in clockwise order. The
					game consists of thirteen rounds and at the end of the thirteenth round then the game will end. (All
					the categories on the players’ score cards will be completely filled in at that point.)
				</p>
				<p>
					At the start of a turn, the player takes all 5 dice and rolls them. They can then roll some or all
					of the dice up to two more times, setting aside any dice they’d like to keep and rerolling the rest.
					The dice can be scored after any of the rolls, but scoring the dice ends the player’s turn. Setting
					dice aside after one roll does not prevent one or more of them from being rolled again on any
					subsequent roll if the player so chooses.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each player’s goal is to try and score as high as they can in one of the thirteen categories shown
					on their score card.
				</p>
				<p>
					To score the dice, the player selects one of the categories on their score card and writes the score
					into it. Each category can be scored only once per game (except for the Yahtzee category).
					Categories can be filled in any order. A player
					<em>must </em>score the dice on their turn even if it turns out that there are no good categories
					remaining to score in. Once a category is filled it may not be changed.
				</p>
				<p>
					A player may write a score of zero in any category if they have rolled no point-generating results
					or if they simply choose to do so. For example, a player could put a roll of 2-4-5-6-6 into the Ones
					category even though it would score zero points.
				</p>
				<p>
					After marking their score on their score card, the player’s turn ends and play proceeds to the
					player on their left.
				</p>
				<p>
					The categories on the score card are divided into two sections. The categories in the Upper Section
					are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Ones</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: Ones<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: Receive 1 point for each 1 rolled
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Twos</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: Twos<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: Receive 2 points for each 2 rolled
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Threes</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: Threes<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: Receive 3 points for each 3 rolled
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Fours</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: Fours<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: Receive 4 points for each 4 rolled
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Fives</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: Fives<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: Receive 5 points for each 5 rolled
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Sixes</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: Sixes<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: Receive 6 points for each 6 rolled
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Ultimately, each player will want to try and score a grand total of 63 or more points in the Upper
					Section by the end of the game. If they do so, they receive a 35 point bonus.
				</p>
				<p>The categories in the Lower Section are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Three of a Kind</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: Three dice of the same number<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: Add up all the spots on all the dice. (For example, rolling
						2-2-2-3-5 would score a total of 14 points.)
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Four of a Kind</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: Four dice of the same number<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: Add up all the spots on all the dice
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Full House</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: Three dice showing the same number, and two dice showing
						another number.<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: 25 points
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Small Straight</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: Any four consecutive numbers (for example, 3-4-5-6)<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: 30 points
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Large Straight</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: Any five consecutive numbers (for example, 1-2-3-4-5)<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: 40 points
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Yahtzee (or Five of a Kind)</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: All 5 dice showing the same number<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: 50 points
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Chance</b><br />
						<em>What is needed to score</em>: Any combination of dice<br />
						<em>How many points are scored</em>: Add up all the spots on all the dice
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					It’s possible that a player will end up with a combination of dice that could be used in more than
					one category. For example, a roll of 3-3-3-4-4 could be scored as threes or fours in the Upper
					Section, or as a Full House or a Three-Of-A-Kind, or Chance in the Lower Section. The player has the
					option of scoring the dice in any one of those categories as long as they have not been used
					previously in the game.
				</p>

				<h3>Special Yahtzee Scoring</h3>
				<p>
					If a player rolls a Yahtzee on their turn but they have already filled in the Yahtzee category in a
					previous turn, then special scoring rules apply:
				</p>
				<p>
					If the player has already filled in their Yahtzee box with a score of 50, they receive a Yahtzee
					bonus of 100 additional points. However, if their Yahtzee box was previously filled in with a score
					of zero then they don’t receive the Yahtzee bonus.
				</p>
				<p>
					The player then selects another category (other than the Yahtzee category) to score the dice as
					normal.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						If the category in the Upper Section that corresponds to the numbers in the Yahtzee is unused,
						then the player must use that category.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the corresponding box in the Upper Section has been used already then the player may choose
						to score one of the unused boxes in the Lower Section. In this case, the Yahtzee that the player
						has rolled acts as a “Joker” so that it can be placed in the Full House, Small Straight, and
						Large Straight categories if the player so wishes, even though it may not meet the standard
						requirements for those categories.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If the player can’t use a box in either the upper or Lower Section, they score zero points.</p>
				<h2>Winning</h2>
				<p>
					Once all players have taken thirteen turns (and subsequently filled in all the categories on their
					score card) the game ends.
				</p>
				<p>Players add up their scores in the following manner:</p>
				<p>
					<b>Upper Section</b><br />
					Mark the total sum of the Upper Section score in the corresponding total score box. If a player
					scores 63 or more points in the Upper Section then they receive a 35 point bonus.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Lower Section</b><br />
					Mark the total sum of the Lower Section score in the corresponding total score box. Add 100 points
					for each check in the Yahtzee bonus box.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Grand Total</b><br />
					Add the total sums of the upper and Lower Sections together. This is the player’s total score for
					the game.
				</p>
				<p>
					The player with the highest total score is the winner! In the case of a tie, all tied players share
					the victory.
